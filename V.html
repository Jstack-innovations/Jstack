  <h1>Digital Education System – Professional Conversation Flow</h1>
  <p>
    This document represents the recommended conversation structure when presenting
    the Digital School Portal and Tech Capability Program to schools, students, and parents.
  </p>

  <!-- SCHOOL INTRO -->
  <h2>1. Conversation: Developer → School Management</h2>

  <div class="speaker">You:</div>
  <div class="speech">
    I operate a structured digital education system designed to modernize school operations
    and introduce controlled technical capability to students.
  </div>

  <div class="speaker">You:</div>
  <div class="speech">
    The system includes a school portal, CBT exams and quizzes, academic records,
    and a structured tech skills exposure program.
  </div>

  <div class="note">
    (Pause. Allow the school to ask questions.)
  </div>

  <!-- TECH PROGRAM -->
  <h2>2. Explaining the Tech Skills Program</h2>

  <div class="speaker">School:</div>
  <div class="speech">
    What does the tech program involve?
  </div>

  <div class="speaker">You:</div>
  <div class="speech">
    I offer multiple tech stacks such as web development, digital skills,
    and software fundamentals. Each school selects one stack only.
  </div>

  <div class="speaker">You:</div>
  <div class="speech">
    Training delivered inside the school is foundation-level.
    It provides exposure and understanding, not specialization.
  </div>

  <!-- BOUNDARY -->
  <h2>3. Defining Clear Boundaries</h2>

  <div class="speaker">You:</div>
  <div class="speech">
    My full professional training program is not sellable or hireable
    by any single institution.
  </div>

  <div class="speaker">You:</div>
  <div class="speech">
    Schools participate through structured partnerships.
    Depth and mastery are handled independently by my teams.
  </div>

  <!-- STUDENT PATH -->
  <h2>4. Student Advancement Path</h2>

  <div class="speaker">School:</div>
  <div class="speech">
    How do interested students become professionals?
  </div>

  <div class="speaker">You:</div>
  <div class="speech">
    Students who want professional-level competence enroll in my
    external mastery program.
  </div>

  <div class="speaker">You:</div>
  <div class="speech">
    Under my teams, students can reach industry-ready capability
    within six to twelve months, depending on commitment.
  </div>

  <!-- PAYMENTS -->
  <h2>5. Payment & Revenue Structure</h2>

  <div class="speaker">You:</div>
  <div class="speech">
    The school pays for the portal and the in-school exposure program.
  </div>

  <div class="speaker">You:</div>
  <div class="speech">
    Parents pay directly for professional training.
    The school earns a commission for students enrolled through them.
  </div>

  <!-- HIRING -->
  <h2>6. Hiring Clarification</h2>

  <div class="speaker">School:</div>
  <div class="speech">
    Can we hire you fully?
  </div>

  <div class="speaker">You:</div>
  <div class="speech">
    Hiring applies only to one selected tech stack and is part-time.
    The full professional program remains independent and non-negotiable.
  </div>

  <!-- STUDENTS -->
  <h2>7. Communication to Students</h2>

  <div class="speaker">You:</div>
  <div class="speech">
    What you are learning here is the foundation for this tech stack.
  </div>

  <div class="speaker">You:</div>
  <div class="speech">
    Professional mastery happens through a separate program.
    Details are available through the school.
  </div>

  <!-- VALUE -->
  <h2>8. Final Positioning</h2>

  <div class="speaker">You:</div>
  <div class="speech">
    This is not a tutoring arrangement.
    It is a structured digital capability partnership.
  </div>

  <div class="speaker">You:</div>
  <div class="speech">
    The school gains prestige, efficiency, and revenue.
    I retain program control, quality, and scalability.
  </div>
