<h1>School Portal Pitch</h1>

<h2>1. Walk-in / Introduction</h2>
<p>
Good morning, sir/ma. My name is <span class="highlight">Samson</span>, and I’m the tech lead from [Your Organization Name]. 
We specialize in modern school management systems. I just wanted to come by today to show you a system that many schools are using 
to <span class="highlight">automate everything from enrollment to grading</span>, and also make life easier for teachers, administrators, and even parents.
</p>

<h2>2. Ask About Current System / Pain Points</h2>
<p>
If you don’t mind me asking, how are you currently managing student enrollment, course registration, and exam grading? 
Is it all manual, or do you have some software in place?
</p>
<p>
Oh, I see. That’s actually very common. Many schools we’ve worked with struggled with paperwork piling up, exam results taking days to process, 
and parents always calling for updates. That’s exactly what our system addresses.
</p>

<h2>3. Introduce the Ecosystem / Evaluation Plan</h2>
<p>
Here’s the exciting part — we’re running what we call a <span class="highlight">10-day evaluation plan</span>. 
For just <span class="highlight">$35</span>, your school can get <span class="highlight">full access to the ecosystem</span> and see exactly how it works in real life. 
This is not just a portal; it’s a <span class="highlight">complete school management system</span>.
</p>
<p>
They can test everything — student enrollment, course registration, academic calendar, announcements, fee management, 
CBT exams, CBT assignments and quizzes, transcripts, and even parent access to student performance. Basically, the system runs like a modern school bot, 
saving your staff hours of work every day.
</p>

<h2>4. Highlight Benefits</h2>
<p>The benefits for your school and students include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Reduce manual errors and save staff time</li>
    <li>Automate grading and transcript generation</li>
    <li>Track fees and payments without chasing parents</li>
    <li>Students gain <span class="highlight">more tech knowledge</span> and adapt to modern digital tools</li>
    <li>Teachers and students stay in sync with the global digital educational ecosystem</li>
    <li>CBT exams, assignments, and quizzes improve assessment accuracy</li>
    <li>Parents can see student performance in real time, increasing trust and satisfaction</li>
    <li>Prepares students for a digital world and prevents them from falling behind in the 21st century</li>
</ul>
<p>
As the world evolves, everything in it evolves. We can’t remain in the 21st century practicing methods from the 15th century. 
This system exposes your students and staff to modern learning while aligning your school with global educational standards.
</p>

<h2>5. Explain the Evaluation → Full Adoption Process</h2>
<p>
During this 10-day evaluation, the $35 fee is just for limited setup — it gives you access to test the system and see how it saves time and reduces stress. 
If you decide to adopt the system, this $35 is <span class="highlight">deducted from the full installation fee</span>, so you’re not paying extra.
</p>
<p>
The full installation fee is normally $800, but as part of our <span class="highlight">early adopter incentive</span> for the first five schools, 
we’ve reduced it to <span class="highlight">₦500,000</span>, to encourage schools to join our ecosystem and start benefiting from digital learning right away.
</p>
<p>
If, for any reason, you decide after the 10 days to not proceed, the evaluation ends, and any access beyond that would require full payment to continue.
</p>

<h2>6. Close the Conversational Pitch</h2>
<p>
So that’s basically it. What I’d love to do today is show you a <span class="highlight">live demonstration</span> of how it works — 
how simple it is to enroll students, run exams, manage fees, and generate reports automatically. 
That way you can see first-hand how much time and stress it can save your school.
</p>
<p>
Would it be okay if we set up the evaluation for your school starting this week?
</p>

<h2>Tips While Speaking</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Keep your tone friendly, confident, and not pushy</li>
    <li>Smile, maintain eye contact, and pause after key benefits</li>
    <li>Listen more than you speak; respond to their pain points naturally</li>
    <li>Lead with time-saving, stress reduction, and digital learning benefits</li>
    <li>Offer the demo immediately — seeing the system makes closing much easier</li>
</ul>
